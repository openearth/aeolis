Welcome to AeoLiS's documentation!
==================================

AeoLiS is a process-based model for simulating aeolian sediment transport in situations where supply-limiting factors are important, like in coastal environments. Supply-limitations currently supported are moisture content, sediment sorting and armouring and bed slope effects.

AeoLiS is developed and maintained by `Bas Hoonhout <b.m.hoonhout@tudelft.nl>`_. The source code can be found at `<https://github.com/openearth/aeolis>`_.
