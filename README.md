# aeolis
AeoLiS is a process-based model for simulating aeolian sediment transport in situations where supply-limiting factors are important, like in coastal environments. Supply-limitations currently supported are moisture content, sediment sorting and armouring and bed slope effects.

AeoLiS is developed and maintained by [Bas Hoonhout](b.m.hoonhout@tudelft.nl). Documentation can be found at (http://openearth.github.io/aeolis/).

AeoLiS is developed at [Delft University of Technology](http://www.tudelft.nl) with support from the ERC-Advanced Grant 291206 Nearshore Monitoring and Modeling ([NEMO](http://nemo.citg.tudelft.nl>)) and [Deltares](http://www.deltares.nl>).
